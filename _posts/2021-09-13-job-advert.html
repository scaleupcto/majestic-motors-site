                <p class="lead">Due to growth in the business we are looking for skilled technicians at either a mid or senior level to join our team on the mechanical side of the workshop.</p>

                <p>Majestic Motors is a classic car restoration company based near Kenilworth, West Midlands. We specialise in restoration, maintenance and upgrade of vehicles pre-1990, typically most vehicles are 1960s, 1970s and increasingly 1980s. In the last year we have worked on Mercedes, Alfa Romeo, Porsche, Jaguar, Triumph, Morgan and many other marques.</p>

                <p>Our engineering background means we are able to design and manufacture obsolete or upgrade parts in house. Increasingly, many of our customers are looking for a classic style with modern reliability, so upgrades to electronics, engine/transmission swaps and addition of creature comforts are becoming common.</p>

                <p>Candidate must have the ability and may be required to demonstrate the following skills:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Excellent mechanical knowledge of all automotive systems to include but not limited to; brakes, steering, suspension, interior trim, transmission, engine, carburettor tune, ignition system, auto electrics.</li>
                    <li>Candidates must have a passion for older and classic vehicles, we want a true petrol head.</li>
                    <li>The ideal person will be conscientious but able to work quickly. Attention to detail is essential, someone who really takes pride in their work.</li>
                    <li>We only work to the highest standards and time is allowed to ensure the job is done right.</li>
                    <li>Candidates ideally must have experience on many vehicle types, makes and models.</li>
                    <li>Senior candidates will be required to spend time mentoring apprentices</li>
                    <li>Race team experience beneficial - via our sister company Majestic Motorsport, occasionally customers require us to support them on events and we have our own race car we run a few times a year.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In return we offer the opportunity to work on some landmark projects in a friendly, family-feel setting from a rural location away from a high pressure environment you might find at a main dealer or larger business. We expect each employee to enhance what we can offer customers, there are no small cogs in a large machine here.</p>

                <p>Current active projects you could be working on:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Conversion of Alfa GT Junior restomod to EFI</li>
