            This was a fun project with many Alfaholics-sourced fast road parts - a South African built 1967 Alfa Romeo Giulia Super. The car came to us as a recent import with 2000 running gear, and a simple brief from the new owner: Do whatever you would do to your own car, but make it stop, go and handle as well as it can - and create the perfect comfortable fast road car for classic tours and weekend runs into Wales.

            The timescales involved meant we were unable to perform a body restoration in this visit, so it was quickly decided that no panelwork or paint would form part of the plan. On arrival, the engine ran badly, the gearbox had engagement issues and the brakes barely worked. Closer inspection revealed worse - a homebrew wiring loom, dangerously assembled suspension, poor condition hydraulics and seats poorly secured using thin set screws being just some of the further issues discovered. As the project unfolded, there was more to come...

            Seeing as the car was already far from original, the decision was made to comprehensively mechanically rebuild the entire car using upgraded or new parts, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Full front and rear suspension rebuild including new components and an Alfaholics fast road handling kit, adjustable front top arms, uprated roll bar with KONI yellow dampers. The front bump stop arrangement was modified to the later 105 series arrangement. Components refinished using the process we use for all full restorations - acid dip, light blast, e-coat and powder coat - providing better than new protection to major premium manufacturers’ OE standards. Only the original front uprights and lower wishbone arms were reused from the tired setup the car arrived with.</li>
            <li>Complete replacement of the braking system, newly piped throughout using an Alfaholics dual circuit master cylinder conversion kit, 4 pot calipers to the front. Stainless steel over braided hoses used, and servos deleted.</li>
            <li>RHD wiring looms are unavailable for the Super, and like most SA cars this vehicle had a mixed specification with some earlier and some later electrical equipment. Rather than modify one of the mixed-quality aftermarket replacement looms to suit, we engineered a new custom loom with modern relays and individual fused circuits for each function, hidden away in a discrete fusebox in the factory location - ensuring reliability.</li>
            <li>On inspection the engine had very low compression and an oil analysis revealed extreme petrol contamination suggesting glazed bores - so a full engine rebuild was undertaken. The twin Weber 40 carbs were also rebuilt.</li>
            <li>The gearbox was fully rebuilt, with casings aqua blasted back to as new cosmetic condition. The rear casing had been profiled at some point in its life to compensate for an incorrectly fitted rear gearbox mount bush, and as a result had cracked. We performed a professional aluminum weld repair, and built the correct shape back up. New clutch master and slave cylinders were fitted. The clutch fork was found to be cracked, so a replacement was sourced.</li>
            <li>The rear axle was an Alfa Romeo Berlina plate-type LSD with 4.3 ratio ideal for touring - but it was leaking and had seen better days. The whole assembly was aqua blasted back to as new cosmetic condition and an Alfaholics racing LSD with copper sintered friction plate design fitted, with road-friendly ramps. New bearings and seals, plus a new handbrake mechanism completed the axle.</li>
            <li>The interior had been dubiously retrimmed in South Africa. To fit with the comfortable fast road touring use, we retrimmed the interior using very high quality Bridge of Weir leather. Only the original rear seats were retained, new custom leather door cards were commissioned with new door hardware, and a set of Alfaholics GTA-R front seats were retrimmed, with added seat heating. We reworked the floors, as we do on all 105 restomod projects, to improve the compromised RHD driving position by optimising the height and offset of the seat mounts to suit aftermarket seats properly. The leatherwork has subtle red double stitching to complement the exterior colour. The rear shelf, previously cut for speakers, was retrimmed.</li>
            <li>The fuel tank had been badly repaired, so a new fuel tank was sourced, new copper fuel and ethanol resistant flexible lines and fuel filters fitted.</li>
            <li>Four new Michelin 15” tyres fitted, in 175 profile to ensure plenty of clearance to the rear arches and in consideration of the power output and intended use of the vehicle - ensuring a fun balance of playful handling and grip.</li>
            <li>A full four wheel alignment was performed using our motorsport setup plates and wheel hubs, including corner weighting. Although the rear has little adjustment being a live axle and trailing arm setup, often the correct shimming of the rear axle is overlooked on these cars and most come into the workshop with the rear wheels offset from the front.</li>
        </ul>

            Extensive post-build road testing revealed a car we were reluctant to return to the owner - just because of how fun it is. Although the engine has been rebuilt to the standard specification (the Sport exhaust the car came in with is the only performance modification) it turns out a 2000 unit in a Super is plenty fun. The car rides brilliantly, tracks straight and true and benefits from the stability afforded by the longer wheelbase 105 saloon configuration.

            The first thing that hits you on slipping into the bespoke interior is the smell of the hide. Window down, autumn sun through the front screen with the seat heaters on, plus the burble of the sports exhaust, all add to the experience. Unlike lesser-axled 105 series cars, pulling out of a tight junction or exiting a damp roundabout does not result in the surfeit of power spinning up the inside rear wheel. Instead, small controllable slides are on offer, should the mood take you - on an appropriate private road or track, of course.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our opinion this car represents the perfect fast road touring car experience. All we need is a trio of minis to chase - had the Carabinieri benefited from this specification, The Italian Job might have needed an alternative ending!
