            <h1>Engineer's Inspection Report</h1>
        </div>

        <p class="lead">
            If you've recently acquired a new classic vehicle, considering bringing an old flame out of long term storage or even forming a plan for a rolling restoration, why not consider one of our engineer's inspection reports?
        </p>

        <p>Our degree-level trained automotive engineer spends two hours with your car or motorbike first on the ramp and then out on the road, and you receive a typed report documenting any areas of concern - ranked from 1 (needs immediate attention) to 5 (cosmetic concern only).</p>

        <p>The inspection report covers:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Bodywork/chassis</li>
            <li>Exterior trim</li>
            <li>Suspension and steering</li>
            <li>Brakes</li>
            <li>Powertrain</li>
            <li>Electrical</li>
            <li>Wheels and tyres</li>
            <li>Road test (if safe and legal to do so)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At Â£130+VAT, it's a cost effective way to properly assess the condition of your vehicle, also ideal as an independent pre-purchase inspection.</p>

        <h2>Example report</h2>

        <p>Below is an example inspection report for a very tidy-looking Triumph Stag that came into the workshop last year. The car had an issue with the rear suspension sitting too low and was leaking power steering fluid, both of which the owner was aware of.</p>
        
        <p>The report also revealed the car was leaking fluid from the rear differential, as well as some simpler but essential maintenance items such as wheel bearing adjustment, perished track rod end boots and a dangerous section of fuel hose which required replacement. These unknown items were cheap to remedy, but for safety reasons did require immediate attention.</p>
        
        <p>Whilst in generally excellent condition, we were also able to suggest some corrosion protection to prevent surface rust developing into something more serious - again dealt with economically.</p>
