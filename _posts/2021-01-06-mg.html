            <h2>Servicing, repair, recommissioning and restoration</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="lead">At Majestic Motors we have extensive experience with all models of MG including MGA, MGB, MGC, Midget and even the pre-war models such as the J-Type.</p>

        <p class="lead">We can offer simple servicing, through mechanical recomissioning or overhaul, to full body restoration and trim.</p>

        <p class="lead">Below you'll find a small sample of the project work we have completed recently:</p>

        <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>MG B Roadster bodywork repair</li>
            <li>MG A Chassis repair</li>
            <li>MG C Full mechanical recommissioning</li>
            <li>MG J2 Full recommissioning and engine rebuild</li>
            <li>MG B Coupe mechanical work and kingpin replacement</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="mgb-bodywork-rpair">MG B Roaster bodywork repair and full respray</h4>

        <p>This B Roaster came to us as a tidy looking car with some rust bubbling in the rear arch area. Unfortunately it had been repaired poorly in the past and required whole new
            lower wing areas letting in as well as some work to the inner arches and sill ends. We also reshaped the rear bootlid for a better fit, made repair panels for the inner quarters
            (a previous owner had cut holes for speakers) and finished the car with a complete respray.
        </p>

        <h4 id="mga-chassis-repair">MG A Chassis repair</h4>

        <p>This MGA chassis had been repaired and patched over the years, and required replacement to both main chassis rails either side of the passenger compartment.
            The owner wanted to make sure it was straight and true before embarking on a home restoration.</p>

        <p>We secured the chassis at the main hard points to our chassis table and measured to make sure it remained square and true whilst we cut out, remade and replaced sections
            of the rails.
        </p>

        <p>This kind of work is impossible to do properly without use of the table to maintain the integrity of the chassis</p>

        <h4 id="mgc-recomissioning">MG C Coupe major mechanical, electrical recomissioning and trim</h4>

        <p>
            This MG C came to us having been hastly assembled elsewhere. We built a new wiring loom, reconditioned all the running gear including e-coating 
            all the suspension and re-trimmed and sound-proofed the interior.
        </p>

        <h4 id="mg_j2">MG J2 Full recommissioning and engine rebuild</h4>

        <p>
            This J2 was restored many years ago and had been laid up by the owner due to a water leak from the block. We dismantled the engine and sent the block
            away for specialist repair. We are now rebuilding the engine to original specification, as well as attending to the usual recommissioning items when a car has been
            laid up for a period - brakes, fuel system, electrics.
        </p>

        <h4 id="mgb-mechanical">MG B Coupe Mechanical work and kingpin replacement</h4>

        <p>This MG B had been subject to an engine rebuild elsewhere but was not running correctly and had not been used much in the last couple of years.
            The owner commissioned one of our <a href="/services/inspection-report/">engineer's inspection reports</a> which lead to some recommendations
            including re-torquing the head, setting the valve clearances, installing electronic ignition and tuning the carbs.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
            With the engine running correctly we also fixed an issue with the driver's door handle and fuel gauge, and addressed worn front kingpins - a common MOT failure point
            on these cars.
        </p>
