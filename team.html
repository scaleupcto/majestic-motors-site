                <h4>Ben Thompson</h4>
                <h5><em>Technical Director</em></h5>
                <p>
                    Ben started Majestic Motors in 2015 after a 15-year career in the automotive industry as a Design and
                    Production Engineer, working for iconic brands such as Triumph Motorcycles, Aston Martin, Marcos, and TVR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Majestic Motors, Ben heads up the workshop side of the business, supporting technicians and overseeing quality. He also
                    designs and engineers custom components, estimates jobs and assesses and diagnoses vehicles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ben has an eclectic collection of classic cars, most - truth be told - in need of full restoration. His favourite
                    marque is Mercedes Benz - between them, he and his partner own a pair of SLs - one classic, one modern!

                    Becky joined Majestic Motors in 2020. Previously a BMW-trained master technician, she decided a career in modern vehicle maintenance was not for her and made the move to classics a couple of years ago.

                <p>
                    She has owned and restored a number of BMW 3-series (E30) models, and is also a keen drift racer in her Nissan Silvia.

                <p>
                    Paul joined Majestic Motors in 2018 following a long career in bodywork and accident repair. He is a master fabricator and is generally

                <p>
                    Paul restores his own vehicles in his spare time - he is currently completing his VW bay window camper - but his favourite marque
                    is Alfa Romeo, owning both a Brera (daily driver) and a 105-series GTV.
